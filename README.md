# Sole Mate

## Overview

The **Sole Mate** is a unique running platform designed to motivate users to complete a group run by leveraging social accountability. In this app, users can create or join running sessions with friends, track their progress in real-time, and stay motivated to finish the session. If any participant fails to meet the required distance or time, the entire session is canceled, and everyone's progress is lost. This creates a fun but serious push to ensure that everyone contributes and finishes the session together.

## Key Features

- **Create a Running Session**: Set up a session with a specific time or distance goal for all participants.
- **Invite Friends**: Add friends via the app or share a link to invite others to join the running session.
- **Group Accountability**: If anyone in the session doesn't meet the target distance or time, a message like "Session is canceled because of [Name]" is shown, and all participants' records are deleted.
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Track each participant’s progress in real-time to stay updated on who might need extra encouragement.
- **Motivation Through Social Pressure**: The app is designed to motivate everyone to keep running by making sure that no one wants to be the person responsible for canceling the session.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Session**: 
   - Set a goal for the session, either by time (e.g., 30 minutes) or distance (e.g., 5 kilometers).
   - Invite friends directly or via a unique shareable link.

2. **Join a Session**:
   - Friends can accept your invite to join the session. Once they accept, they will appear in the session list.

3. **Start Running**:
   - The session begins once everyone is ready. Each participant’s progress is tracked.
   - All participants must keep running for the required distance or time. If anyone stops before the goal is reached, the session is canceled.

4. **Avoid Cancellation**:
   - If a participant fails to meet the required time or distance, a message appears: "Session is canceled because of [Participant's Name]".
   - All progress for that session is lost, motivating everyone to finish the run together to avoid being the reason for cancellation.
